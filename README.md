TTCSubway
=========
The startings for a mobile app to provide users with information to make their ride on the TTC subway more efficient.
The app will be able to tell someone which door on the train that they must enter from in order to either minimize
the number of people around them, or to minimize the distance they must travel along the platform once they get to
their destination station. This version is preliminary in order to determine the algorithms that will be used in the
app. Currently have an algorithm to determine the shortest path from one station to another, which factors in interchange
stations as well as allows the user to specify if they desire a wheelchair accessible route. All information about the
subway is stored in an xml file.

Created January 2014.
