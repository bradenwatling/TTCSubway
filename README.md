TTCSubway
=========
The startings for a mobile app to provide users with information to make their ride on the TTC subway more efficient.
The app will be able to tell someone which door on the train that they must enter from in order to either minimize
the number of people around them, or to minimize the distance they must travel along the platform once they get to
their destination station. This version is preliminary in order to determine the algorithms that will be used in the
app.

Created January 2014.
